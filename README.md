# HitFilmDiscordRichStatus
A python script that automatically detects a running instance of HitFilm Express, and updates Discord Rich Status accordingly

This script currently only works on Windows, as it relies on OS-specific APIs. However I don't see why porting it to other platforms is not possible. I just don't have the hardware to test that out
